rules of the game

Every hour the program counts and records. As soon as it is opened, it will count 
how many hours have passed since the previous opening and calculate how many stats need
to be taken away from animals and the zoo.

Every hour the load on the enclosure increases. If the enclosures are too dirty, the penguins' 
temperature will rise and they will all die.
If the lions are too hungry, they will all kill each other because the anger stat will increase

Same with monkeys

If the elephants are hungry, their fear will increase and they will scare away visitors. Because of which the zoo will pay a fine of half the balance


Animals can be fed
Buy. You also need to buy food
The number of animals in the zoo is limited
The number of enclosures too
If there is no enclosure for the animal, you cannot buy it
You can clean the enclosures so that the penguins don’t die and it’s clean

If the hunger stat drops, it increases the drop in other stats.

The more animals in the zoo, the higher the income level.
